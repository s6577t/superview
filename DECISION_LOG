1) JQUERY is a dependency for supermodel
	(standard!)
	
2) NO CSS by default
* CSS was supposed to separate presentation from content (HTML)
* but now, we do layout in the javascript and most importantly...
* views ARE our separation from content.
* we've gone beyond static documents and need more powerful technologies (hence SCSS)

3) Every view can have a controller. Views create and manage subviews. A view can set itself a controller
which would be responsible for handling view events and mapping changes to the model. Views know about subviews,
controllers only know about the view they are attached to and the model.
CONTROLLER: 
* map between VIEW and MODEL events and updates
* handle any socket or browser based events that affect the controllers view
VIEW: display data, emit events such that controllers can effectively receive and update the model
MODEL: hold data and logic, emit events such that controllers can effectively receive and update the view


A Superview.extend({}) syntax is not used because it doesn't allow for object member to be defined in the constructor
