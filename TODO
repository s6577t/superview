1:
  a: fix basic superview.position
  b: finish impl superview.restrictions
  c: handle css filtering
    > Superview#css()
    > checks border metrics compared to before css changes
      and resizes the view etc.
    > faux pas: margin, border, padding, position, dimension, max-dimension, min-dimensions
      FILTER these from calls
    > delete the css method from return jqueries
  d :contentArea()
    > view.contentArea().[resize|moveTo|size|position|restrictTo|anchorTo]()

modularize: viewtree+rect are standard, anchoring is a mixin (but all superviews have it)

2: padding and border css intercepts -> trigger event
3: refactor anchoring and fix fractional positioning bug (if it exists?)
4: detect and refuse cyclic anchoring
5: ancestor anchoring behaviour revision
6: anchorBoundsTo handling
7: fix draggable with padding/border bug

>: if I bind a box to the right of something and then resize it, it should still stick to the right
        > visual spec
        > spec
>: if I bind to the right of an ancestor I don't want it's right position, I want width (similar with bottom/height)
        > visual spec
        > spec

>: dragging with a border sent the position F**king crazy

>: raise an error if there are cyclic anchorings

>: setting paddings and borders causes a resize .css({}) intercept border/padding changes

>: RETEST visual and spec: fractional layouts anchorTo(..., {left: 0.5})

>: bounds (max/min inner/outer Top|Left|Right|Bottom|Width|Height) should be anchorable too! bounds() and anchorBoundsTo()

>: run tests and view visuals in Safari and Firefox and on the iPad
