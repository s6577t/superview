/ 1: implement draggable and resizable so I can visually test the bindTo functionality 

/ 2: make bindTo have sensible outer and center options
    > probably automatically bind to inner if binding to a parent, outer otherwise
    > bindTo(view, {
      // this would align the box in the middle horizontally
      // should probably post process the binding to see if it had top AND bottom (or left AND right)
      // values for the new rect and if it has, position equally between them leaving only top/left
      top: true|'top'|0
      bottom: true|'bottom'|1,
      // do similar for left and right
      left,
      width,
      height
    })
  
/ 3: Use Superview for hyperglyphics
