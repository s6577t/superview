/ 1: implement draggable so I can visually test the bindTo functionality 


/ 2: make bindTo have sensible outer and center options and offset +/-C options
    > probably automatically bind to inner if binding to a parent/ancester, outer otherwise
    > bindTo(view, {
      // this would align the box in the middle horizontally
      // should probably post process the binding to see if it had top AND bottom (or left AND right)
      // values for the new rect and if it has, position equally between them leaving only top/left
      top: true|'top'|0
      bottom: true|'bottom'|1,
      // do similar for left and right
      left,
      width,
      height
    })
    
    A) DO bindTo specs check that if passes otherView, otherRect and otherOuterRect to the top,left,bottom,right etc. functions?

TEST: spec every view must be triggered onReszie/onMoved on initialize

/ 3: views might have a relativePath() and path() for hashbangs. Page should return '/'.

    // if make masquerades as the root view then parent() should return null, but _parent should still be the window
      // ^^^ would this get ugly?
  
/ 4: Use Superview for hyperglyphics
