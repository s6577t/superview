/ 1: fitWindow (bindTo) does not size the page until the window fires a resize event se >>a>> below

/ 2: implement draggable and resizable so I can visually test the bindTo functionality 

/ 3: implement initialization protocol:
  > in the ctor, assemble the view tree (not including any dynamically created views), and controller, and any styling and classes
  > in 'bind()' (noop default) listen to events from other views and perform and bindTo()s
>>a>> The initialization sequence would then trigger onMoved() and onResized() events  
  > in 'populate()' call controller().<populate_delegate> for initial data payload, calls 'populate()' by default
  > in 'repopulate()' call controller().<repopulate_delegate> for latest data
  > a recursive render function which can be called on the root view to call bind and populate recursively
    NOTE: thinking of handling the recursion entirely from within the render function, NOT with any bindSubview() delegates etc.
  
/ 4: Use Superview for hyperglyphics
