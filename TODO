1: size and position bounds and callbacks
1b: outerMoveTo() -> moveTo() no more outerMoveTo
1c: remove padding and paddingMetrics. padding should not be necessary with this layout system
resize({width:, height:}, {includeBorder: true});

CSS_FILTER:
-> faux pas: margin, border, padding, position, dimension, max-dimension, min-dimensions

2: padding and border css intercepts -> trigger event
3: refactor anchoring and fix fractional positioning bug (if it exists?)
4: detect and refuse cyclic anchoring
5: ancestor anchoring behaviour revision
6: anchorBoundsTo handling
7: fix draggable with padding/border bug

>: if I bind a box to the right of something and then resize it, it should still stick to the right
        > visual spec
        > spec
>: if I bind to the right of an ancestor I don't want it's right position, I want width (similar with bottom/height)
        > visual spec
        > spec

>: dragging with a border sent the position F**king crazy

>: raise an error if there are cyclic anchorings

>: setting paddings and borders causes a resize .css({}) intercept border/padding changes

>: RETEST visual and spec: fractional layouts anchorTo(..., {left: 0.5})

>: bounds (max/min inner/outer Top|Left|Right|Bottom|Width|Height) should be anchorable too! bounds() and anchorBoundsTo()

>: run tests and view visuals in Safari and Firefox and on the iPad
