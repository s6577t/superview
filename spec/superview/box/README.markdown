# Superview box functionality specs

The following functions are specced in this directory for the boundary _and_ content area boxes:

* resize
* moveTo
* restrictTo
* restrictions
* size
* position

There are a considerable number of specs related to this functionality some of which apply to both the boundary box and the content area box. 

Those specs which are applicable to both boxes are in `abstract_box_specs.js`, box specific specs are in the respective files.
