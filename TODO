!: Fix Firefox failing specs

3: calls to css() for top,left,right,bottom,width,height should result in a call to resize/moveTo
4: reintroduce anchoring and fix fractional positioning bug (if it still exists?)
  > anchorTo restriction callback
  >: if I bind a box to the right of something and then resize it, it should still stick to the right
          > visual spec
          > spec
  >: if I bind to the right of an ancestor I don't want it's right position, I want width (similar with bottom/height)
          > visual spec
          > spec
  >: RETEST visual and spec: fractional layouts anchorTo(..., {left: 0.5})
4b: reintroduce page/window specs            

5: ancestor anchoring behaviour revision
6: anchorRestrictionTo handling - if it's quick to do
7: resizeable() and draggable()
8?: change to use api like Superview.extend({}) rather than MyView() { Object.extend(this).withMixin(Superview)}
9: run tests and view visuals in Safari and Firefox and on the iPad
10: review and document initialization protocol
11: add presenter getter/setter
  > presenter formats data for the view, what is the reverse process?
12: Write visual specs, examples and documentation

13: make it so the superview can automatically resize to fit it's contentArea to the total outer dimensions of the jQuery contents(). this involves three things methods: 
a) A function to size the superview to according to it's contents
b) some logic in updated() that updates the size when content changes
c) A function to enable to the automatic updating of contentArea size when updating


14: allow root superview to be position: relative
